# Welcome to my LeetCode solutions 
This repo collects my solutions to LeetCode problems in C++, Java and Python3. 

As new problems come up in weekly and biweekly contests, I will update this repo once the contests are over. 
Here, I try my best to make every solution as self-contained as possible. 
Due to the limited space, the details of the algorithms are not given. 
The readers are encouraged to look them up. Some good resources include 

* "Algorithms, Part I & Part II" by prof. Robert Sedgewick from Princeton University 
  + https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1
  + https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2
* "Algorithms Specialization" by prof. Tim Roughgarden from Stanford University 
  + https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms

In addition, relevant implementations are available in my cp_algorithms repo.
